    "content": "## Learning Objectives\n\n- Describe the structure and purpose of the SAT Reading & Writing module.\n- Explain scoring, timing, and adaptive modules.\n- Recognize common passage types and question categories.\n- Apply a simple read\u2013predict\u2013select routine to short SAT items.\n\n## Overview of the Test\n\n### Section Objectives\n- Identify the module format and navigation basics.\n- Understand that questions are discreet and multiple-choice (A\u2013D).\n- Practice a fast read\u2013predict\u2013select routine.\n### Lecture Script\n- (mini_lecture, 5 min): The digital SAT Reading & Writing has two adaptive modules with short passages and one question each. All items are multiple-choice A\u2013D, and you may flag and return within a module.\n- (think_aloud, 4 min): I skim the passage first for the gist, predict the answer in a few words, then match that prediction to the option that best fits while eliminating distractors.\n- (guided_practice, 4 min): We\u2019ll try one item together. I\u2019ll model how to underline the key claim and test each option against that claim.\n- (quick_check, 2 min): Thumbs: Who feels clear on the module structure and the read\u2013predict\u2013select routine?\n### Worked Example\n**Passage:** Maya arranged the lab samples methodically, noting that careful order reduced mistakes and sped analysis. Her mentor watched, smiling at the quiet efficiency.\n**Question:** Which choice best states the main idea of the passage?\nA. Maya dislikes working in laboratories.\nB. The mentor corrects Maya\u2019s inefficient method.\nC. Maya\u2019s organized approach improves accuracy and speed.\nD. The lab is too noisy for careful work.\n**Correct Answer:** C\n**Explanation:** The passage emphasizes that order reduces mistakes and speeds analysis, showing organization improves accuracy and speed.\n### Practice Set\n- U1S1_P1: The city council posted summaries before meetings so residents could preview proposals and prepare comments.\n  Q: The passage primarily shows the council\u2019s goal to\n  A. discourage participation\n  B. limit proposals\n  C. increase informed feedback\n  D. speed votes by excluding debate\n  Correct: C\n## Scoring & Timing\n\n### Section Objectives\n- Explain the 200\u2013800 section score scale.\n- Allocate time per question using benchmarks.\n- Practice skipping, flagging, and returning efficiently.\n### Lecture Script\n- (mini_lecture, 5 min): Your Reading & Writing section score ranges from 200\u2013800. Manage time by aiming for a steady pace and using flags to revisit tougher items within a module.\n- (think_aloud, 4 min): If an item feels sticky after 20\u201330 seconds, I pick the best option so far, flag it, and move on to protect later points.\n- (guided_practice, 4 min): We\u2019ll simulate two quick items with a visible timer and practice making fast, confident choices.\n- (quick_check, 2 min): What\u2019s our rule when stuck: guess-and-flag or dwell? State it in one phrase.\n### Worked Example\n**Passage:** Because the conference schedule was dense, Jordan reviewed abstracts the night before to decide which talks to attend first.\n**Question:** What strategy does Jordan use to manage limited time?\nA. Skipping the conference\nB. Randomly choosing talks\nC. Previewing abstracts to prioritize\nD. Leaving early\n**Correct Answer:** C\n**Explanation:** Jordan previews abstracts to prioritize, mirroring time management and prioritization.\n### Practice Set\n- U1S2_P1: During the test, Priya flagged two questions that required more careful reading and answered easier ones first.\n  Q: Priya\u2019s approach primarily aims to\n  A. reduce total questions\n  B. maximize points by pacing\n  C. avoid reading\n  D. change the scoring scale\n  Correct: B\n## Types of Passages & Questions\n\n### Section Objectives\n- Recognize literary, historical, scientific, and informational passages.\n- Identify common question types (main idea, evidence, words in context).\n- Apply elimination using passage-based reasoning.\n### Lecture Script\n- (mini_lecture, 5 min): Expect brief literary, historical, scientific, and informational texts. Questions target main ideas, evidence, words in context, structure, and standard English conventions.\n- (error_analysis, 4 min): We\u2019ll examine a trap answer that is true but not relevant, and show why relevance to the question is essential.\n- (guided_practice, 4 min): Let\u2019s label the passage type and question type before choosing an answer.\n- (exit_ticket, 2 min): Write one sentence naming a passage type and the best first step you\u2019d take.\n### Worked Example\n**Passage:** In 1913, the suffragists\u2019 parade drew national attention, transforming a local campaign into a movement that pressed lawmakers to act.\n**Question:** Which choice best captures the central idea?\nA. Parades always change laws.\nB. A 1913 parade amplified a political movement.\nC. Lawmakers dislike public events.\nD. Local campaigns are ineffective.\n**Correct Answer:** B\n**Explanation:** The sentence says the parade drew attention and transformed the campaign, amplifying the movement.\n### Practice Set\n- U1S3_P1: The engineer compared energy outputs from two solar prototypes, concluding that small design tweaks significantly improved efficiency.\n  Q: This passage is best categorized as\n  A. literary narrative\n  B. scientific/informational\n  C. historical speech\n  D. humorous anecdote\n  Correct: B\n## Unit Check\n- U1_UC1: Which action most directly supports effective pacing on the SAT?\n  A. Reread every passage twice\n  B. Answer easy items first and flag tough ones\n  C. Skip the last module\n  D. Avoid using the timer\n  Correct: B\n- U1_UC2: The SAT Reading & Writing questions are primarily\n  A. short-answer\n  B. essay\n  C. multiple-choice A\u2013D\n  D. fill-in-the-blank\n  Correct: C\n- U1_UC3: A statement that is true but not tied to the question is best eliminated for lacking\n  A. relevance\n  B. length\n  C. vocabulary\n  D. humor\n  Correct: A\n- U1_UC4: The section score range for Reading & Writing is\n  A. 0\u201336\n  B. 200\u2013800\n  C. 1\u20135\n  D. 400\u20131600\n  Correct: B\n## Homework\n- Create a one-page summary of the SAT R&W format and pacing rules.\n- Complete five mixed items using the read\u2013predict\u2013select routine and annotate traps.\n- Set a personal timing benchmark (items per 5 minutes) and test it on 10 questions.\n## Answer Key\n- U1S1_P1: C\n- U1S2_P1: B\n- U1S3_P1: B\n- U1_UC1: B\n- U1_UC2: C\n- U1_UC3: A\n- U1_UC4: B"

Hold up your letter.\n### Worked Example\n**Passage:** Although the plan was meticulous, the hikers turned back when an early storm froze the trail and blocked the pass.\n**Question:** Which choice best supports the claim that conditions forced a retreat?\nA. The plan was meticulous.\nB. An early storm froze the trail and blocked the pass.\nC. The hikers liked warm weather.\nD. The pass is popular in summer.\n**Correct Answer:** B\n**Explanation:** Option B directly states the conditions that caused the retreat.\n### Practice Set\n- U2S1_P1: The curator kept the painting in low light because its pigments, fragile with age, faded under stronger lamps.\n  Q: Which choice best supports the claim that the curator prioritized preservation?\n  A. The painting was famous.\n  B. It was kept in low light to protect pigments.\n  C. Visitors preferred bright rooms.\n  D. The museum recently renovated.\n  Correct: B\n## Command of Evidence (Quantitative)\n\n### Section Objectives\n- Read titles, axes, and units before interpreting values.\n- Connect visual data to textual claims.\n- Avoid overgeneralizing beyond the figure.\n### Lecture Script\n- (mini_lecture, 5 min): Always parse the figure: title, variables, scale, and trend. Then match the exact claim to the exact data point or pattern.\n- (guided_practice, 6 min): We\u2019ll annotate a small table and cross-check which option accurately cites the numbers.\n- (quick_check, 4 min): If the claim says \u2018largest increase,\u2019 what two numbers must we compare? Answer in one phrase.\n### Worked Example\n**Passage:** Figure: A table shows year 1 = 40 participants, year 2 = 50, year 3 = 70 in a school science fair.\n**Question:** Which statement is best supported by the table?\nA. Participation decreased from year 1 to year 3.\nB. The largest increase occurred between years 2 and 3.\nC. Year 2 had the most participants overall.\nD. Year 1 and year 2 had equal participation.\n**Correct Answer:** B\n**Explanation:** Values rise 40\u219250 (+10) then 50\u219270 (+20); the larger increase is 2 to 3.\n### Practice Set\n- U2S2_P1: Figure: A bar chart shows library visits per month: Jan 200, Feb 220, Mar 260.\n  Q: Which choice accurately describes the trend?\n  A. Visits drop steadily.\n  B. Visits remain constant.\n  C. Visits increase each month.\n  D. March has the fewest visits.\n  Correct: C\n## Central Ideas & Details\n\n### Section Objectives\n- Identify a passage\u2019s main claim.\n- Differentiate central ideas from minor details.\n- Use wording that paraphrases rather than copies.\n### Lecture Script\n- (mini_lecture, 5 min): Main ideas explain the passage\u2019s purpose. Details serve that purpose. Prefer options that capture the whole point without overspecifying.\n- (error_analysis, 5 min): We\u2019ll reject a choice that quotes a detail but misses the broader claim.\n- (guided_practice, 5 min): Underline the author\u2019s purpose verb and complete the sentence: \u2018The author argues that\u2026\u2019\n### Worked Example\n**Passage:** Community gardens, beyond supplying produce, build trust among neighbors who meet regularly to plan, plant, and share the harvest.\n**Question:** Which choice states the central idea?\nA. Gardens are expensive.\nB. Community gardens foster social connections in addition to food.\nC. Only experts can garden.\nD. Harvests are unpredictable.\n**Correct Answer:** B\n**Explanation:** The sentence emphasizes both produce and building trust-social connections beyond food.\n### Practice Set\n- U2S3_P1: The biography notes that early failures taught the artist techniques later evident in widely praised works.\n  Q: What is the central idea?\n  A. The artist avoided failure.\n  B. Failures informed later success.\n  C. Praise is unreliable.\n  D. Biographies are fictional.\n  Correct: B\n## Inferences\n\n### Section Objectives\n- Make logical conclusions supported by the text.\n- Avoid speculation beyond the passage.\n- Use evidence to justify the inference.\n### Lecture Script\n- (mini_lecture, 5 min): An inference is a justified conclusion, not a guess. Ask: If the text is true, what must also be true?\n- (think_aloud, 5 min): The narrator \u2018checks the door twice\u2019; I infer anxiety or caution because the action signals concern about security.\n- (quick_check, 3 min): Which choice goes beyond the text? Call it when you hear unrelated claims.\n### Worked Example\n**Passage:** Hearing the thunder grow nearer, Lina moved the metal chairs indoors before locking the garden gate.\n**Question:** What can be reasonably inferred about Lina?\nA. She dislikes rain in general.\nB. She anticipates risk and acts to prevent damage.\nC. She plans to sell the chairs.\nD. She is ignoring the storm.\n**Correct Answer:** B\n**Explanation:** She moves metal chairs and locks the gate as the storm approaches-preventive action shows anticipation of risk.\n### Practice Set\n- U2S4_P1: When the auditorium lights dimmed, the presenter paused until the last whispers faded, then began.\n  Q: What is the most reasonable inference?\n  A. The presenter forgot the topic.\n  B. The audience was small.\n  C. The presenter waited for attention before starting.\n  D.

Provide an example\nB. Signal a contrast to a prior assumption\nC. Indicate a cause\nD. Summarize a result\n**Correct Answer:** B\n**Explanation:** \u2018However\u2019 introduces a contrast between assumption and new data.\n### Practice Set\n- U3S2_P1: The device saves energy; therefore, it reduces monthly costs for users.\n  Q: The underlined transition primarily shows\n  A. contrast\n  B. cause-and-effect\n  C. chronology\n  D. definition\n  Correct: B\n## Cross-Text Connections\n\n### Section Objectives\n- Synthesize ideas across two related short texts.\n- Identify agreements, disagreements, or complementary evidence.\n- Choose an option that accurately represents both texts.\n### Lecture Script\n- (mini_lecture, 6 min): Read Text 1 and Text 2 for claims, then ask: How do they relate-support, qualify, or oppose?\n- (think_aloud, 8 min): Text 1 says urban trees cool streets; Text 2 notes shade lowers energy use. They complement the same idea: cooling benefits.\n- (quick_check, 6 min): Is the proposed statement true for both texts? If not, it\u2019s out.\n### Worked Example\n**Passage:** Text 1: A survey finds bike lanes increase local shop visits. Text 2: A case study reports higher weekend sales after a new lane opened.\n**Question:** Together, the texts primarily suggest that\nA. bike lanes always reduce traffic\nB. bike lanes may boost nearby commerce\nC. shopping causes bike lanes\nD. weekends are the only profitable days\n**Correct Answer:** B\n**Explanation:** Both texts connect bike lanes with increased shopping activity.\n### Practice Set\n- U3S3_P1: Text 1: Students who slept 8 hours performed better on recall.
